# What is Hydra?

Hydra is a lightweight framework written in TypeScript designed to solve Edge caching challenges for GraphQL endpoints such as automated caching and invalidation of relevant cached queries, built-in security.

## Core aspects

- Self-hosted framework
- Operates natively with Authdog backend (OpenID, Authz)
- Cost effectiveness, 100% Edge Computing based
- Automated mutation based invalidation
- Automated cache segmentation
- Cloudflare opinionated (KV, Durable Objects)


Most Hydra operations can be achieved through Hydra CLI.


## How does it work?

Hydra acts as an Edge Gateway for GraphQL, meaning Hydra will generate its own unified GraphQL schema from existing GraphQL schema.
Requests sent to a Hydra endpoint will automatically cache the queries payload. Queries have dedicated types with their ids stored as metadata in KV.
If a given Mutation returns a type with ids in KV, it'll automatically invalidate any matching query in KV with a similar type.


## Setup Process

Assuming `hydra CLI` is installed in your environment, the initial step is generally to generate a dump of the remote endpoints from a given configuration `hydra.config.ts` in the current project.
Once this dump has been successfully generated, it'll be accessible in `.hydra/schemaRaw.js`.
Then this generated file will be consumed by Hydra handlers to dynamically generate a JIT unified GraphQL schema.
