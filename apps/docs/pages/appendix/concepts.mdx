## Caching

In short Hydra's caching provides a way to read data stored in a cache automatically, instead of consuming data from the actual downstream APIs.
Thus access to payload is significantly faster if a corresponding payload exists in cache for a given query.

## Cache Keys Segmentation

Keys are segmented in the cache to permit caching in different contexts (e.g.: queries cached for a given user, queries cached with specific variables)

Cache keys contains informations about the query, respectively

- `user:query:variables` for authenticated queries
- `query:variables` for public queries

### Composites

- `user` is a hash of a given authenticated user identifier.
- `query` is a hash of a given GraphQL query.
- `variables` is a hash of a given GraphQL query variables stored as an array of key/value
