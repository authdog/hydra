# Concepts

## Caching

In short Hydra's caching provides a way to read data stored in a cache automatically, instead of consuming data from the actual downstream APIs.
Thus access to payload is significantly faster if a corresponding payload exists in cache for a given query.

## Cache Keys Segmentation

Keys are segmented in the cache to permit caching in different contexts (e.g.: queries cached for a given user, queries cached with specific variables)

Cache keys contains informations about the query, respectively

- `user:query:variables` for authenticated queries
- `query:variables` for public queries

### Composites

- `user` is a hash of a given authenticated user identifier
- `query` is a hash of a given GraphQL query
- `variables` is a hash of GraphQL query variables set

## Cache Invalidation

Hydra's cache invalidation provides a way to invalidate a given cache entry, or a set of cache entries, based schema types.

Assuming a mutation that creates a new `Book` in the system, owned by a given `User` type, if the mutation returns the `User` type with its `id` field, then Hydra will automatically invalidate the cached records and every associated records from the cache.

## Rate Limiting

Hydra's rate limiting provides a way to limit the number of requests to a given API in a given time frame.
This is defined by a rate limit policy, which is a set of rules that define the number of requests that can be made in a given time frame.

For instance, you can define a policy to protect a given endpoint with a rate limit of 100 requests per minute.
