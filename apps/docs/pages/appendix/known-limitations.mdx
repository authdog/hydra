# Known Limitations

## Types Collision

If more than one GraphQL is being used, there's a chance of collision for types.

## Cache value size

- Cloudflare Worker KV value has an arbitrary maximum size of 25 MiB. ([reference](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/storage-options/#comparison))
